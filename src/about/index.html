<blockquote style="margin-left: 0rem; margin-right: 2rem; font-family: georgia,serif; line-height: 1.6rem"><p>„I explore myself and the world around through feelings, transforming them into symbols. I arrange my reality with my artwork. It is a way of communicating with people. There are subtleties of perception, vague sensations, events of the inner life which cannot be described in words, while the language of symbols - mostly universal.“</p></blockquote>
